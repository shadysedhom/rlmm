Phase 0 Environment + repo skeleton
Phase 1 Collect ~ 2 weeks of real-time order-book data
Phase 2 Build a simple playback (simulation) engine
Phase 3 Add performance metrics (Sharpe, max drawdown, etc.)
Phase 4 Implement & test a baseline quoting strategy - skew mid spread (no ML yet)
Phase 5 Plug in an RL agent (Stable-Baselines3 PPO)
Phade 6 Refactor code for simplicity, readability, and code quality
Phase 7 Visualize the results & write a report to reflect
